<h1>Secure Access Control System</h1>
    
<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>This project aims to create a secure access control system using a PIC16F877 microcontroller and various components</p>

<h3>System Components:</h3>
<ul>
<li>PIC16F877 microcontroller operating at a frequency of 8 MHz.</li>
<li>4x3 matrix keypad connected to PORT D for access code entry.</li>
        <li>Stepper motor to lock/unlock the entrance door.</li>
        <li>16x2 LCD screen for displaying messages and system status.</li>
        <li>LM35 analog temperature sensor (ADC).</li>
        <li>EEPROM memory to store the correct access code.</li>
        <li>"CHANGE" push-button (RA4) for accessing code modification mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Implementation:</h3>
<p>The system will use the matrix keypad for access code entry, the stepper motor to control the entrance door lock, and the LCD screen to display messages and system status. The LM35 temperature sensor will provide temperature data. The EEPROM memory will store the correct access code, and the "CHANGE" push-button will be used to enter code modification mode.</p>

<p>Actual programming and integration of these components will be done using a microcontroller programming language, such as C for PIC microcontrollers.</p>
